ssue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from May 26, 2024, at 10:00 PM GMT to May 27, 2024, at 3:00 AM GMT.
Impact: Our web application experienced a complete downtime, affecting 80% of our users. Users attempting to access the platform encountered HTTP 503 errors, resulting in frustration and loss of productivity.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on one of our application servers, ultimately causing it to crash.
Timeline:
10:00 PM GMT: The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in HTTP 503 errors.
10:05 PM GMT: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a potential database failure due to recent updates.
10:30 PM GMT: Database integrity checks and rollback procedures were initiated but yielded no significant findings.
11:00 PM GMT: As the investigation continued, attention shifted towards the load balancer configuration, suspecting a potential routing issue.
11:45 PM GMT: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified as the root cause.
12:00 AM GMT: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for immediate resolution.
1:30 AM GMT: The misconfigured load balancer settings were corrected, restoring normal traffic distribution.
3:00 AM GMT: Full service recovery was confirmed, and the incident was officially resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of incoming traffic, causing one of the application servers to become overloaded and eventually crash.
Resolution: The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among all available application servers, preventing overloads and ensuring system stability.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to catch misconfigurations early.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Develop and implement a checklist for load balancer configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Conduct a comprehensive review of all critical system configurations to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
Enhance team training and documentation on troubleshooting procedures for load balancer-related issues.
This outage served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of robust monitoring and proactive maintenance in ensuring the reliability and resilience of our web infrastructure. Through swift identification and resolution of the root cause, followed by the implementation of corrective measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future, ultimately providing our users with a more stable and reliable service.
